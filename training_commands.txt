1) Generate Training images from training datasets: The first step is to determine the full character set to be used, and prepare a text or word processor file containing a set of examples. The most important points to bear in mind when creating a training file are:

	* Make sure there are a minimum number of samples of each character. 10 is good, but 5 is OK for rare characters.
	* There should be more samples of the more frequent characters - at least 20.
	* Don't make the mistake of grouping all the non-letters together. Make the text more realistic. For example, The quick brown fox 		  jumps over the lazy dog. 0123456789 !@#$%^&(),.{}<>/? is terrible. Much better is The (quick) brown {fox} jumps! over the $3,456.78 		  <lazy> #90 dog & duck/goose, as 12.5% of E-mail from aspammer@website.com is spam? This gives the textline finding code a much 		  better chance of getting sensible baseline metrics for the special characters.

	training/text2image --text=training_text.txt --outputbase=[lang].[fontname].exp0 --font='Font Name' --fonts_dir=/path/to/your/fonts

2) Run tesseract for training

	tesseract [lang].[fontname].exp[num].tif [lang].[fontname].exp[num] box.train

3) Compute the Character Set: Tesseract needs to know the set of possible characters it can output. To generate the unicharset data file, use the unicharset_extractor program on the box files generated above

	unicharset_extractor lang.fontname.exp0.box lang.fontname.exp1.box

	
4) Set Unicharset properties: allow the addition of extra properties in the unicharset, mostly sizes obtained from fonts.

	training/set_unicharset_properties -U input_unicharset -O output_unicharset --script_dir=training/langdata

5) font_properties: The purpose of this file is to provide font style information that will appear in the output when the font is recognized

	<fontname> <italic> <bold> <fixed> <serif> <fraktur>

6) Clustering: When the character features of all the training pages have been extracted, we need to cluster them to create the prototypes.

	shapeclustering -F font_properties -U unicharset lang.fontname.exp0.tr lang.fontname.exp1.tr

7) Machine Training using mftraining: mftraining will produce a shapetable which contains shape of your fonts.

8) Putting it all together
